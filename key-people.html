            <h4 class="person--title"> “CAPTAIN CONSCIENTIOUS” </h4>
            <p class="person--description"> As a lawyer and a software developer, Pat spends all his time turning complex messy things into simple, ordered things. Described by a former supervising partner as "a dog with a bone", Pat works creatively and relentlessly to help his clients get wealthy. Pat taught himself to code after leaving a top tier law firm in Sydney and then started Query Law as a software driven law firm. When he’s not lawyering, Pat is the lead software developer at treescribe.com. </p>

            <h4 class="person--title"> “LITIGATION SPECIALIST” </h4>
            <p class="person--description"> Tom is the Query Law go to for all things litigious and contentious. Tom qualified in Queensland in 2008 and has since worked as a litigation lawyer in various top tier Australian, UK and US firms throughout the world. Tom is also qualified as a lawyer in England and Wales. In what little free time Tom has, you can find him at a gym practicing a technical, sneaky Jiu-Jitsu leg-lock game, or by a body of water fishing. </p>

            <h4 class="person--title"> “LITIGATION SPECIALIST” </h4>
            <p class="person--description"> Working with Andrew is like working with future Artificial Intelligence. Provide a problem with clear parameters and you will get back a perfectly reasoned answer that is always correct. Occasionally, you'll find out that the parameters you provided are inconsistent in some way, but you'll still get the right answer with an explanation of why your parameters should have been different. With an engineering background, Andrew works at Query because he deeply enjoys solving data problems (which is most of what legal practice really is) that don’t require getting micromanaged in an office cubicle. </p>

            <h4 class="person--title"> “MAN OF LETTERS” </h4>
            <p class="person--description"> Rod holds a Law Degree and worked as a journalist in Australian  newspapers for five years before working as a paralegal. Journalism was  great preparation for his work in the legal field.  As well as ably  handling multiple work streams with strict deadlines, Rod's experience  digging through local, state and federal government documents to  identify pertinent issues honed his skills in due diligence.  Since he  believes firmly that life is supposed to be interesting, Rod has written  four books, worked as the head chef in an East Timorese restaurant,  managed a pub in Singapore and worked as a jackaroo and copper miner in  Outback Australia.

            <h4 class="person--title"> “COMPETITOR” </h4>
            <p class="person--description"> Lee's an engineer who loves working with people (a rarity). Those characteristics, along with the fact that he's helplessly competitive, make Lee a perfect one-man-marketing-department for 2020. Lee is a former medical device programmer who decided he needed more human contact, so he left that job to figure out how to make his way in the world.  Pat recruited Lee in a shipping container cafe as Lee faced an existential crisis about what to do after becoming financially independent using his engineering savvy in digital marketing.
